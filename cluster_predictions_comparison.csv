24188,"I mean, this might just be a personal difference, but if I'm watching a movie and someone just takes a sip out of a pepsi can, that doesn't automatically drag me out of immersion at all. Because taking a sip of a branded beverage is actually a normal activity that people in real life do all the time, so it doesn't register to me as unusual enough to notice. There have been times where I've totally not noticed product placement in media until the second or third viewing, because it was placed into the scene naturally and subtly enough that I wasn't paying conscious attention to its presence. (My subconscious probably noticed it and was influenced by it, which would probably make it effective marketing, but that's a different topic.)

What takes me out of the movie is when the movie *unnaturally emphasizes* the pepsi can in some way. For example, if they frame the shot of the person drinking so that the can is in the focal area of the screen instead of the person's head; or if they leave the branded beverage in grame for an unusually long amount of time. If the brand logo is conspicuously displayed in the background of an important scene, or if it's mentioned by name in the dialogue in a way that's not entirely natural. When the movie places any undue amount of *focus* on the existence of the branded object, as though it were relevant to the story or plot (like, say, the brand of soda was an important clue to the identity of the killer or something), but it's not actually part of the story or plot. That's when the presence of product placement actively interferes with my enjoyment of a movie, because the movie itself is actively being interfered with.

Now, when it comes to controversial political/social topics like the inclusion of gay people in media - in instances where they aren't an integrated part of the story, themes, or plot - I think it's fair to consider this in similar terms. Is the movie *unduly focusing* on the existence of this topic? (In, again, a way that isn't part of the story?) Are they unusually framed or given an unusually long amount of time on screen? Do characters bring up the existence of these gay people in situationally unnatural dialogue? Are they being focused on any more than a straight couple would be focused on in the exact same scenario? Because if not... it's not actually interrupting the movie in any way. It's simply being *included*. And if the sheer inclusion of a gay couple is so shocking to you that it completely drags you out of the movie and into thinking about why the hell a company would do that, then like, not to put too fine a point on it, but maybe the movie isn't the primary source of the problem here...?

Ultimately, I get the whole thing about being sick of rainbow-washing and corporate hypocrisy. I do. I'm not blind to Disney's lengthy list of flaws, and I'm no more thrilled than the next millenial to have corporate suits trying to shill me focus-group palatable mass-market bullshit. But personally, I think that on the whole it's a *good* thing that corporations are trying to pander to the LGBT demographic, because it means __we're winning the culture war__. We and our allies are now a sizeable enough demographic to be catered to, and they're simping for our dollars like they simp for everyone else's dollars. We're being included and normalized! Our existence in films and media is *what we've been fighting for* for years!

everything you asked for in the next switch, are all features found on the ps vita. 

ps4 had less features than ps3, and ps5 has less features than ps4. 

we STILL supporting the companies we all complain about

correction, YOU are supporting the companies you all complain about, .


I stopped investing in these garbage practice a long time ago. 

I don't buy cosmetics. I don't buy battlepass. not even with free points. 

I don't buy new games that I know are just clones of older games. 

I don't buy old games for full price. 

I don't buy old games just because they are on sale for their real price. 

I don't pay for any game I wouldn't enjoy 100%



anyways, 


innovation isn't profitable, everyone is so, absolutely stupid, (most of you, sorry reader, but you did pay 60$ for a game that's 6 years old) 


innovation isn't profitable, so they cut features, and put as little into their product as possible. 


what is so special about the switch? 

the joycon is the most special thing about the switch, and that was a disaster for a while. 


there is nothing special about the switch. it overheats when playing simple games. 
the screen is barely decent. 


the game selection is pathetic. and full of junk.

Nintendo hasn't come out with any new original ideas in a couple decades now. 

it took them 30 years to make a 3d pokemon world. and the 3d pokemon game is mostly just, trees. and fields. 



we continuously get slapped around by these companies and you still have the nerve to ask them for nice things? 



the ps vita came out like over a decade ago. 
it had, 
the ability to call people. you could use the ps vita as a cellphone. 
it had a Sim card, that let you play online anywhere with full connection. 


it had a touchscreen, on the front, and a second touchscreen, on the back, 

both front and rear cameras, not cheap cameras either, 

dual joysticks (pretty awesome upgrade from psp single joystick) 

it had some of the most fun and unique games I've ever seen, that utilized all the ps vita innovative features. 




that was my favorite console, and my favorite Era of gaming, 

after 2013/2014 began the age of monetization of all things. 

along with that, companies decided innovation is not as profitable, 

they have the financial influence to control what people do.

they can cut all features and leave us with nothing, and we still smile, defend the business, and shell out cash, for trash and spit in our face, 


fully immersive vr gaming could be something we've been had as common as any console, 

but nobody invested in innovation, so we still play games the same way we did on wii and ps2, 


honestly, 


how is the switch different from a Nintendo ds? it has less features. 


the ds. the original first ds, had more features than the switch. 



this is pathetic, everyone praising the switch, people suggesting ""ohh hey Nintendo, you know what would be cool, if you gave us cool stuff to do"" 

they are laughing at you. 


please, kill off any hope or positivity you have for the company, 

the next console is going to sell you games you already have on the switch, for 60$, 

we won't even need that console, but they are going to convince you to get it, and then convince you to re-buy those games. at full price. 


this really isn't just a rant, 


I'm honestly scared of how dumbed down society is, 


because it's actually all of your faults, all of you paid for this, all of you supported this, 

just because you complain about it on reddit doesn't excuse the fact YOU ARE STILL GIVING THEM ALL THE MONEY THEY ASKED FOR.

This will do 3 things:

1. Force the DoD to deeply research internally if any of his information holds water and is in any way protected information. This means that rogue elements either have to officially come forward to block the release (which would be good, because it finally makes them traceable) OR the information will get out into the public (even better).

2. Give Lue officially green light to talk about A LOT more things. The Pre-Publication Review gives him black-on-white what he can and cannot talk about despite his NDA. No more grey areas, hints, breadcrumbs and fuzziness.

3. Plant a flag in the ground, fixing the current progress of disclosure. There will never be any going back from that point onwards.

All of this, of course, relies on Lue to provide truthful information, backed up by evidence.
